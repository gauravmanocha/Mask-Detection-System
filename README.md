# Mask-Detection-System

In these tough times of COVID-19, wearing a mask is mandatory. Still many people are not wearing a mask. So making a simple and basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow with Keras library which will tell whether the person has a mask on or not makes the job easy. The datasetused for training of the model consists of about 1,376 images with 690 images containing people with face masks and 686 images containing people without face masks. Due to having less number of dataset, Image Augumentation helps a little bit in increasing the dataset.
